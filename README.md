# Example for returning std::error_code

This is an example of making error codes based on Andrzej Krzemienski's post [Your own error code](https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2017/07/12/your-own-error-code/).

Following updates on this repository will build upon the next posts in the series: [Your own error condition](https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/your-own-error-condition/) and [Using error codes effectively](https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/using-error-codes-effectively/).
